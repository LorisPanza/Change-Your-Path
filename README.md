# Change-Your-Path
This is depository for the development of the videogame "Change your Path".
I've created the folder Game Design Document which inside contains the md document that we will update.
In these days I will try to understand well how github works and how we can use it to semplify our comunication.


Issues - This section needs to araise an issue in our devlopment: the other team members will see the issue, discuss, solve and close it.

Pull Request - Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. I update this in another branch.


This is a new update.
